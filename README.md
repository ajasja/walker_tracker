# walker_tracker
Repository for tracking single molecules of walkers on de novo fibers

## Installation
This uses the same environment as ImageAligner. You also need to install the fiji plugin before using the script. Download the files, open fiji -> plugins -> Install... and select the jar file in the folder.
That should be all that's needed. You can call the drift_correction_fiji.py script for one file or the drift_correct_folder.ipynb to correct a whole folder.
